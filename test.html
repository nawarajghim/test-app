<p> 
    In this video, I have learned the concepts of servers, clients and IP address.
     This video makes easier to built a map on how internet works in a simple way.
      Internet is actually a wire which can be in the form of fiber optics, copper or satellites. 
                  Server is a special computer connected directly to the internet and each of its has a unique IP address. 
      Computers uses at home are clients not the server. Home computers are connected to the internet through an ISP which are called servers.
       However, everything that has connected to internet has an IP address for example your home computers or mobile phones.
        Also, I got to know that, IP address is responsible for addressing, delivering and routing any online request precisely to the requested computer or device.
